TAPESTRY.

A beautiful flowing cloth hanging from the walls, telling a story
of times past this one. It can exist in this temporality, or it will
wait to be invoked elsewhen.

these experiences we have, they shape our imagination, our being, and fuel our creations.

anyway you use the darn thing by saying at your command line:
(pretend you're in bash)
you@compy$  ruby tapestry.rb name_of_kamishibai/gamefile.txt > whatever_in_the_heck.tw

if it doesn't work, leave a note in the issue tracker with at least part of the gamefile.txt.

sincerely,
camo.
